# (Templated) ADT Stack

The ADT Stack is a container in which access is restricted to one end of the container, called the topof the stack. 
When a new element is added it will be added to the top, and when an element is removed it is also removed from the top.
In this example, it is represented on a singly linked list, which allows the principal queue operations to be done in **O(1)**.
It is fully templated.
