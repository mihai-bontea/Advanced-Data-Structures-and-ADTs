# Path in a Maze

A maze is a grid of empty and occupied positions. We have a starting position somewhere inside the maze.

* Test whether there is a path which leads to the margin(an exit from the maze).
* Find the shortest path out of the maze(if one exists).

* \* = empty space
* X = occupied 
* R = starting position

For the pathfinding, **Lee(fill)** algorithm was used on the maze. For implementing this algorithm, a
fully templated Queue represented on a singly linked list(SLL) was used.
