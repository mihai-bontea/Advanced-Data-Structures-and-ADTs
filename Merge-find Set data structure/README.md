# Merge-find Set

"A merge-find set, also known as disjoint-set data structure or union-find data structure is a data structure that tracks a set of elements partitioned
into a number of disjoint(non-overlapping) subsets." The main operations, checking whether two elements belong to the same set(**find**) and merging
the sets containing the given elements(**merge**) are done in approximately constant time(bounded by the inverse Ackermann function).

## Uses

Among other applications, disjoint sets are used in the Kruskal's algorithm for determining the **minimum spanning tree**.
