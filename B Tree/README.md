# B-Tree

A B-Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that keeps data in a sorted manner. Similar to other self-balancing trees, it allows searches, insertions and 
deletions in **logarithmic time**. Their height is also O(log n) though it is less in practice because of the large branching factor.

## Usage

"B-Trees are designed to work well on magnetic disks or other direct-access secondary storage devices. B-Trees are similar to red-black trees but they
are better at minimizing disk I/O operations. Many database systems use B-Trees, or variants of B-Trees, to store information."
