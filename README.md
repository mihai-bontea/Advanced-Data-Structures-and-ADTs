# Data Structures and Algorithms

This project is about various ADTs and studying their complexities based on their representation/implementation. 
As representations, dynamic arrays, linked lists, heaps and more will be used. Some of them will be fully templated to extend their usefulness. 
An **ADT(Abstract Data Type)** is a data type in which the objects from the domain are specified independently of their representation and the operations are specified independently of their implementation.
In easier words, to use an ADT all we need to see is its interface(containing the signature of the operations, preconditions and postconditions). 
As an example, we do not need to know that the STL Stack in C++ is a container adapter that uses std::deque by default(typically implemented using a sequence of individually allocated fixed-size arrays) in order to easily use it. 
Advantages of using ADTs include abstraction, encapsulation and flexibility.
	
In addition to the focus on ADTs, the project will also contain **advanced data structures** such as segment trees, 
tries, Fenwick trees etc. implemented in a similar manner, with an easy to use interface.
