# ADT Set

The ADT Set is a container in which elements have to be unique and the order of the elements is not important(there are no positions).
Thus, rather than retrieving a specific element element from a set, one usually tests an element for membership in a set.
In this example, elements can also be added and deleted from the set(it is a **mutable** or **dynamic** set).
Here it is represented on a doubly linked list(DLL).
