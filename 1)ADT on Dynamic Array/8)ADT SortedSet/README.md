# ADT Sorted Set

The ADT Sorted Set is a Set in which the elements are ordered based on a relation.
Thus, rather than retrieving a specific element element from a set, one usually tests an element for membership in a set.
In this example, elements can also be added and deleted from the set(it is a **mutable** or **dynamic** set).
For a sorted set, the iterator has to go through the elements in the order given by the relation.
