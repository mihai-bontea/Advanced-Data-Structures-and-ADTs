# ADT Map

ADT Map(or dictionary, associative array, symbol table) is a container which stores <key, value> pairs, and in which the keys appear at most once in the
collection, and in no particular order. The main operations are: the addition of a pair to the collection, the removal of a pair from the collection,
retrieving the value associated to a given key, and the modification of an existing pair.
The iterator for this container returns <key, value> pairs.
